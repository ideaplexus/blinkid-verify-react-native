## Requirements

SDK package contains MicroBlink framework, IDVerify frameowrk and one sample app which demonstrate framework integration. Framework can be deployed on iOS 8.0 or later, iPhone 4S or newer and iPad 2 or newer. 

SDK performs significantly better when the images obtained from the camera are focused. Because of that, the SDK can have lower perfomance on iPad 2 and iPod Touch 4th gen devices, which [don't have camera with autofocus](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/ipad-2-rear-camera-has-tap-for-auto-exposure-not-auto-focus/12536).
